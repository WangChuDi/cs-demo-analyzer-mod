## Agent Behavior Policy: Worktree First

ALWAYS prioritize using `worktree_create` for ANY new feature development, refactoring, or complex task.

### Worktree Workflow
1.  **Check**: If the user asks for a new feature or significant change.
2.  **Create**: Immediately create a new worktree using `worktree_create` tool.
    - Base branch: `main` or current branch (unless specified).
    - Branch name: `feat/[description]` or `fix/[issue]`.
3.  **Develop**: Perform all file edits, tests, and builds WITHIN the worktree directory.
4.  **Cleanup**: Once merged or approved, remove the worktree using `worktree_delete`.

DO NOT ask for permission to create a worktree. JUST DO IT.
